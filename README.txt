Open index.html to view the website in its current state.

The file index.html was created to be as minimal as possible, containing only
a div with id="root" as the place where dynamically created elements are
rendered and an import for the main javascript file where all elements are
created and rendered. Index.html imports combined.js, which is a concatenation
of all the other javascript files.
